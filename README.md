# WaermebildVisier (thermal in scope)

The thermal goggles (T-7, including the GPNVG-18 Thermal) also work in the scope.

**Why you see nothing otherwise:** A magnifying scope draws its image with its own small camera. That camera only gets thermal vision if the scope itself is a thermal scope. The goggles only sit on the main camera. In addition, the lens image is not drawn at all when thermal is active.

**What the plugin does:** While the goggles are on, it also switches thermal on for the scope camera, with exactly the goggles' values (`WaermebildVisier.cs`), and lifts the lens block (`LinseUndPunkt.cs`). Real thermal scopes (FLIR, Echo1) are still handled by the game itself.

## How this mod was made (AI disclosure)

This mod was **programmed by Claude**, an AI assistant made by Anthropic.
**Kaan was the tester**: Kaan has no programming background, played with the mod
on SPT 4.1.6, reported what went wrong, and Claude fixed it. No human programmer
has reviewed the code. It is open source so anyone can check it — if you find a
bug, please open an [issue](https://github.com/Kaanori/spt-waermebildvisier/issues).

## Requirements

- SPT 4.1.6 (EFT 0.16.9). BepInEx ships with SPT.

## Installation

1. Download `WaermebildVisier-1.1.0.zip` from the [Releases](https://github.com/Kaanori/spt-waermebildvisier/releases) page.
2. Extract it **into your SPT game folder** (the folder that contains `EscapeFromTarkov.exe`).
   The ZIP already has the right layout; the mod ends up in `BepInEx/plugins/`.
   On Windows, make sure "Extract All" does not add an extra subfolder.
3. Restart the game.

## Uninstall

Delete the mod's files from `BepInEx/plugins/` (settings: `BepInEx/config/` for client mods) and restart the game.

## Settings (F12 → WaermebildVisier)

- **Aktiv** (active): on/off
- **Glas ausblenden** (hide glass): hide the reflective scope glass (`GlasAusblender.cs`)

## Building from source

Needs the .NET 10 SDK and an SPT 4.1.6 installation to build against.

```bash
./build.sh             # Linux: build only
./build.sh --install   # build and copy into the game folder
```
```powershell
.\build.ps1            # Windows
.\build.ps1 -Install
```

The game folder is set in `Directory.Build.props` (Windows default `C:/SPT`)
or via the environment variable `SPT_DIR`.
